          <h2>Collection of your personal information</h2>
          <div>
            There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without providing personal 
            information, however, for access to future Master Chef Recipes customer support 
            features you are required to submit personally identifiable information. This may include 
            but not limited to a unique username and password, or provide sensitive information in the

            freight shipping. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information 
            they need to deliver the service. Master Chef Recipes takes reasonable steps to ensure that 
            these organisations are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the 
            protection of your personal information.
